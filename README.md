# SEGYtoSHP

It's a raw and test script to read SEG-Y seismic data and takeout X and Y coordinate to create a new geospatial feature in SHP format. To do so, geopandas and segy.io are the main player to do both activities.

The script remain manually insert - no additional loop has been developed, however, the vision is to create this sort-of-small application to interactively convert the SEGY into Shapefile.
